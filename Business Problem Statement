AdviseInvest company currently loses its revenue as 50% of its customers hasn’t been picking up the scheduled calls. And  also the major issue here is staffing,  the sales representatives has nothing to work during the scheduled time and paying the sales representatives who don't work will be very wasteful and affect the profit.
As a part of analytics , we need to perform predictive analytics  using the customer data  in the company to Predict which customers will pickup the calls during the scheduled time. We’ll use classification algorithm to predetermine the probability of picking up the scheduled call in binary, if the customer attended the scheduled call it is ‘1’ and if the customer doesn’t it is ‘0’
The main objective of the project proposal is to prevent future revenue loss which is caused due to staffing  through identifying the customers who would be more likely to answer the scheduled calls as a result of this, the sales representatives can communicate with the customers without sitting idle and this will increase the company's revenue.
This project will be  appraised as a success  by the stakeholders if the customer calls are increased and the sales representatives will work continuously during the allotted time  by reducing the losses when compared to last 6 month’s data trend.
The scope of the project is to analyze  the customers if they are likely to pick-up the call and there by help the company to win as many customers  as possible. 
I'll be working on this project to provide the solution. I expect the results ready to review by the team by end of this month(XX/XX/XXXX) using the company’s data. Based on the reviews and the necessary add-on’s, the deadline for the project will be December 1 and will be delivered to Director of sales of AdviseInvest during the mentioned timeframe.
